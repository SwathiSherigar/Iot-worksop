# Raspberry Pi Architecture

The Raspberry Pi mainly consists of the following blocks:

### Processor
Raspberry Pi uses **Broadcom BCM2835** system on chip (SoC), which includes an **ARM processor** and a **VideoCore Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)**. It is the heart of the Raspberry Pi, controlling all connected devices and handling computations.

### HDMI
**High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI)** is used for transmitting video and digital audio data to a monitor or TV. This allows Raspberry Pi to connect to any digital display using an HDMI cable.

### GPIO Ports
**General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) ports** allow users to interface various input/output devices.

### Audio Output
An audio connector is available for connecting audio output devices such as **headphones and speakers**.

### USB Ports
A **USB port** allows connection of peripherals such as a **mouse, keyboard, or other input devices**. The system can be expanded by connecting more peripherals via USB.

### SD Card
An **SD card slot** is available on the Raspberry Pi. An SD card with a pre-installed operating system is required for booting the device.

### Ethernet
The **Ethernet connector** provides wired network access and is available only on the **Model B** of the Raspberry Pi.

### Power Supply
A **micro-USB power connector** is used to connect a **5V power supply** to power the Raspberry Pi.

### Camera Module
**Camera Serial Interface (CSI)** connects the Broadcom processor to the Raspberry Pi Camera module.

### Display
**Display Serial Interface (DSI)** connects LCD screens to the Raspberry Pi using **15-pin ribbon cables**. DSI provides a **high-resolution display interface** specifically for video data transmission.

# Architecture of IoT

The **architecture of IoT** is divided into **four different layers**:
1. **Sensing Layer**
2. **Network Layer**
3. **Data Processing Layer**
4. **Application Layer**

## 1. Sensing Layer
The **sensing layer** is the first layer of the Internet of Things architecture and is responsible for collecting data from different sources. This layer includes:
- **Sensors** (e.g., temperature, humidity, motion sensors)
- **Actuators** (e.g., motors, relays)
- **RFID tags and QR codes**

These components gather real-world data like temperature, light, sound, and motion. The data is then transmitted to the **Network Layer** using wired or wireless communication protocols.

---

## 2. Network Layer
The **network layer** is responsible for communication and connectivity between IoT devices and the internet. This layer includes:
- **Wireless Communication Protocols**: WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRa, 4G/5G
- **Gateways & Routers**: Act as intermediaries between IoT devices and cloud servers
- **Security Features**: Encryption and authentication to prevent unauthorized access

The **Network Layer** ensures that data collected from sensors is sent securely to the next layer for processing.

---

## 3. Data Processing Layer
The **data processing layer** is responsible for:
- **Collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data** from IoT devices
- **Storing data in centralized repositories** such as cloud databases or data lakes
- **Using AI & machine learning** to extract meaningful insights

ðŸ”¹ **Example**:  
A **smart home system** collects temperature data from sensors. The **data processing layer** analyzes it and decides whether to turn the air conditioner on or off.

---

## 4. Application Layer
The **application layer** is the topmost layer that interacts with users and provides access to IoT functionalities through:
- **Mobile Apps**
- **Web Portals**
- **Dashboards & APIs**

This layer ensures a **user-friendly interface** for monitoring and controlling IoT devices. It also includes **data visualization, analytics, and automation features**.

**Example**:  
A **smart home app** allows users to:
- Check the temperature
- Turn lights on/off remotely
- Receive security alerts
